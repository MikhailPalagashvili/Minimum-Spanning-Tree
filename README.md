# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
MST of an edge-weighted graph is a spanning tree whose weight is no larger than the weight of any other spanning tree. A cut of a graph is a partition of its vertices into two disjoint sets. A crossing edge is an edge that connects a vertex in one set with a vertex in the other. Starting with all edges colored gray, find a cut with no black edges, color its minimum-weight edge black, and continue until V-1 edges have been colored black. The problem can be solved using Kruskal or Prim's algorithm; I used Prim's algorithm.  Prim's algorithm works by attaching a new edge to a single growing tree at each step: Start with any vertex as a single-vertex tree; then add V-1 edges to it, always taking next (coloring black) the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex on the tree to a vertex not yet on the tree. There is a lazy and eager implementation. The lazy implementation is where you keep all of the ineligible edges on the priority queue after each add and the eager is where delte all of the ineligible edges after each add.. I did it the lazy way and the time complexity is ElogE with space complexity E; the code shows why this is so.
